# PrusaSlicer config file for 3D printer Geeetech Mizar S
There was no slicer config file available for the Mizar S printer. So I made one.
It's going to be handy for someone it is their first 3D printer.
I specify the characteristic of the machine based on my other printers. I provided conservative value with regard to print speed and acceleration. You can most likely increase them once you get
familiar with the machine.

## How to install the config in PrusaSlicer
- Copy the config file PrusaSlicer_config_bundle_mizarS_rt_v2.ini on your computer.
- Install PrusaSlicer. I use version 2.5.
- Once you have install the PrusaSlicer, go to File/Import/Import Config Bundle and select the config file you just copied on you computer. That's it.
